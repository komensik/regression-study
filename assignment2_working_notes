Variables:

-   variable id (respondent ID) (noted only 200 length)

-   time = 10 time periods

-   treat - treated cases when equal to 1

-   y - measured outcomes

Treatment:

-   DiD with entry at treatment (treated units only enter dataset when they receive treatment, controls are the counterfactual trend)

-   treat is time-invariant: each unit has same treatment status across all observed periods

    -   controls (0) are observed for all 10 periods

    -   treated (1) only observed for periods 6-10

-   timing: not staggered, but

    -   control: 1902 observed (full panel)

    -   treated: 98 observed (only 6-10)

    -   treatment happens at time 6 for all units simultaneously

Panel

-   unbalanced – control units = 19,020 observations (1902 x 10)

    -   treated = 490 observations (98 x 5)
